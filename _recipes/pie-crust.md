## Crust & Basics

With a good flaky crust recipe, it is easy to come up with new pie recipes.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binging_with_Babish Basics with Babish] has a fairly good [https://basicswithbabish.co/basicsepisodes/pies recipe] for pie crust which is also pretty easy to make.


To come up with new pies, try mixing fruits with a little corn starch, sugar, and other flavorings.
